# Week 6 Challenge

This week we were asked to create an application that would help you plan a trip around the weather. The app was to provide you with the current weather of a given location, and also a 5 day expected forecast.

To achieve this we were to utilize a weather API - Open Weather Map. On sending a request to this API a promise was returned with an array of information regarding the desired city, which was then to be processed using JSON and used to populate the DOM in the relevant areas.

The app was to list the temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index of the location. An icon was to be included to be reflective of the conditions on a given day, whether it be cloudy, sunny or clear etc, and the UV index was to have an appropriate colour indicating the level of severity.

After searching, the returned information was also saved to local storage and the search item was recorded in the form of a button underneath the main search bar, so the user could quickly recall previous searches.

I found this week to be particularly challenging due to the meticulous nature of filtering through multiple arrays to get the desired information, and building something like this from the ground up really illustrated the need for attention to detail in projects, little things that are usually taken for granted on the web everyday actually require a great deal of forethought.
