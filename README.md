  ## Description
Designed using OpenWeather's API, this app intends to give a comprehensive breakdown of current and upcoming weather conditions from all across the world. User can look up a location using the search bar on the left hand side of the app, where previous searches will also be stored for future reference. Upon searching, the user is presented with the current days forecast, including wind speed, temperature, humidity and UV index, along with the next 5 days predicted conditions.
